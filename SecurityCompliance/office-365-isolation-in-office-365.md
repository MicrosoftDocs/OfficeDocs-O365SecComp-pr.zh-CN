<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p101">Azure Active Directory 和 Office 365 使用高度复杂的数据模型, 其中包括数十个服务、数百个实体、数以千计的关系以及成千上万个属性 (实体、关系和属性通常是特定于应用程序的)。在较高级别, Azure Active Directory 和服务目录是租户和收件人的容器, 它们使用基于状态的复制协议保持同步。除了 Azure Active directory 中保留的目录信息外, 每个服务还有自己的目录服务基础结构 (例如, Exchange Online 目录服务、SharePoint Online 目录服务等)。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p101">Azure Active Directory and Office 365 use a highly complex data model that includes tens of services, hundreds of entities, thousands of relationships, and tens of thousands of attributes (entities, relationships and attributes are often application-specific). At a high level, Azure Active Directory and the service directories are the containers of tenants and recipients, and they are kept in sync using state-based replication protocols. In addition to the directory information held within Azure Active Directory, each of the services also have their own directory services infrastructure (e.g., Exchange Online Directory Services, SharePoint Online Directory Services, etc.).</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p102">在此模型中, 没有一个目录数据源。每个单独的数据段都由特定系统拥有, 但没有一个系统保存所有数据。Office 365 服务与 Azure Active Directory 合作, 以实现数据模型。Azure Active Directory 是共享数据的 "真实系统", 它通常是每个服务通常使用的小数据和静态数据。Office 365 和 Azure Active Directory 中使用的联合模型提供了数据的共享视图。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p102">Within this model, there is no single source of directory data. Every individual piece of data is owned by a specific system, but no single system holds all the data. Office 365 services cooperate with Azure Active Directory to realize the data model. Azure Active Directory is the "system of truth" for shared data, which is typically small and static data used often by every service. The federated model used within Office 365 and Azure Active Directory provides the shared view of the data.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p103">Office 365 同时使用物理存储和 Azure 云存储。exchange online (包括 exchange online Protection) 和 Skype for business 将自己的存储用于客户数据。SharePoint Online 利用其 SQL Server 存储和 Azure 存储, 这就需要在存储级别额外隔离客户数据。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p103">Office 365 uses both physical storage and Azure cloud storage. Exchange Online (including Exchange Online Protection) and Skype for Business use their own storage for customer data. SharePoint Online leverages both its SQL Server storage and Azure storage, which necessitates the need for additional isolation of customer data at the storage level.</span></span>

## <a name="exchange-online"></a><span data-ttu-id="300b4-116">Exchange Online</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-116">Exchange Online</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p104">Exchange Online 将客户数据存储在托管在名为邮箱数据库的可扩展存储引擎 (ESE) 数据库中的邮箱中。这包括用户邮箱、链接邮箱、共享邮箱和公用文件夹邮箱。用户邮箱还可能包括已保存的 Skype for business 内容, 如对话历史记录。用户邮箱内容包括电子邮件和电子邮件附件、日历和忙/闲信息、联系人、任务、便笺、组和推断数据。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p104">Exchange Online stores customer data within mailboxes that are hosted within Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) databases called mailbox databases. This includes user mailboxes, linked mailboxes, shared mailboxes and public folder mailboxes. User mailboxes may also include saved Skype for Business content, such as conversation histories. User mailbox content includes emails and email attachments, calendaring and free/busy information, contacts, tasks, notes, Groups, and inference data.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p105">Exchange Online 中的每个邮箱数据库包含来自多个租户的邮箱。所有邮箱都由授权代码保护, 包括在租赁内。与 Exchange 的本地部署一样, 默认情况下, 仅分配的用户可以访问邮箱。保护邮箱的访问控制列表 (ACL) 包含在租户级别通过 Azure Active Directory 进行身份验证的标识。给定租户的邮箱限制为针对该租户的身份验证提供程序进行身份验证, 其中仅包含来自该租户的用户。属于 TenantA 的内容无法以任何方式通过 TenantB 中的用户获取, 除非 TenantA 明确批准。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p105">Each mailbox database within Exchange Online contains mailboxes from multiple tenants. All mailboxes are secured by authorization code, including within a tenancy. As with an on-premises deployment of Exchange, by default only the assigned user has access to a mailbox. The access control list (ACL) that secures a mailbox contains an identity that is authenticated by Azure Active Directory at the tenant level. The mailboxes for a given tenant are limited to identities authenticated against that tenant's authentication provider, which include only users from that tenant. Content belonging to TenantA cannot in any way be obtained by users in TenantB, unless explicitly approved by TenantA.</span></span>

## <a name="skype-for-business"></a><span data-ttu-id="300b4-127">Skype for Business</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-127">Skype for Business</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="300b4-128">Skype for business 将数据存储在多个位置:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-128">Skype for Business stores data in a variety of places:</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="300b4-p106">包含连接终结点、租户 id、拨号计划、漫游设置、状态状态、联系人列表等的用户和帐户信息存储在 Skype for business Active Directory 服务器以及各种 skype for business 数据库中。台.如果为用户启用了这两个产品或 Skype for business 服务器 (如果用户不是这样), 则联系人列表存储在用户的 Exchange Online 邮箱中。Skype for business 数据库服务器不按租户分区, 但通过 RBAC 强制实施多租户数据隔离。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p106">User and account information, which includes connection endpoints, tenant IDs, dial plans, roaming settings, presence state, contact lists, etc., is stored in the Skype for Business Active Directory servers, as well as in various Skype for Business database servers. Contact lists are stored in the user's Exchange Online mailbox if the user is enabled for both products, or on Skype for Business servers if the user is not. Skype for Business database servers are not partitioned per-tenant, but multi-tenancy isolation of data is enforced through RBAC.</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="300b4-p107">会议内容 (如在 Skype for business 会议中上载的内容用户) 存储在分布式文件系统共享上。此外, 还可以在 Exchange Online 中存档此内容, 并启用存档功能。DFS 共享不按每个租户进行分区, 但内容通过 acl 加以保护, 并且通过 RBAC 强制实施多租户。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p107">Meeting content, such as content users upload during Skype for Business meetings, is stored on Distributed File System shares. This content can also be archived in Exchange Online provided archiving is enabled. The DFS shares are not partitioned per-tenant but the content is secured with ACLs and multi-tenancy is enforced through RBAC.</span></span>
- <span data-ttu-id="300b4-p108">呼叫详细信息记录 (如呼叫历史记录、im 会话、应用程序共享、im 历史记录等) 也可以存储在 Exchange Online 中, 但大多数呼叫详细信息记录临时存储在呼叫详细信息记录 (CDR) 服务器上。不对每个租户对内容进行分区, 但通过 RBAC 强制实施了多租户。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p108">Call detail records, which is the activity history, such as call history, IM sessions, application sharing, IM history, etc., can also be stored in Exchange Online, but most call detail records are temporarily stored on call detail record (CDR) servers. Content is not partitioned per tenant, but multi-tenancy is enforced through RBAC.</span></span>

## <a name="sharepoint-online"></a><span data-ttu-id="300b4-137">SharePoint Online</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-137">SharePoint Online</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p109">SharePoint Online 独有的几种独立的机制可提供数据隔离。SharePoint Online 将对象存储为应用程序数据库中的抽象代码。例如, 当用户将文件上传到 SharePoint Online 时, 会反汇编该文件并将其转换为应用程序代码, 并将其存储在多个数据库的多个表中。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p109">There are several independent mechanisms unique to SharePoint Online that provide data isolation. SharePoint Online stores objects as abstracted code within application databases. For example, when a user uploads a file to SharePoint Online, that file is disassembled and translated into application code and stored in multiple tables across multiple databases.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p110">如果用户可以直接访问包含数据的存储, 则不会将内容 interpretable 到 SharePoint Online 之外的人或任何系统。这些机制包括安全访问控制和属性。如上所述, 所有 SharePoint Online 资源均由授权代码和 RBAC 策略 (包括租赁内的) 进行保护。保护资源的访问控制列表 (ACL) 包含在租户级别进行身份验证的标识。与 Exchange online 一样, 在 SharePoint online 中, 给定租户的数据仅限于针对该租户的身份验证提供程序进行身份验证, 其中仅包含来自该租户的用户。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p110">If a user could gain direct access to the storage containing the data, the content would not be interpretable to a human or any system other than SharePoint Online. These mechanisms include security access control and properties. As described above, all SharePoint Online resources are secured by the authorization code and RBAC policy, including within a tenancy. The access control list (ACL) that secures a resource contains an identity that is authenticated at the tenant level. As with Exchange Online, in SharePoint Online, data for a given tenant are limited to identities authenticated against that tenant's authentication provider, which include only users from that tenant.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p111">除了 acl 之外, 指定身份验证提供程序 (即租户特定的 Azure Active Directory) 的租户级别属性只写入一次, 并且在设置后不能更改。为租户设置身份验证提供程序租户属性后, 将无法使用公开给租户的任何 api 对其进行更改。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p111">In addition to the ACLs, a tenant level property that specifies the authentication provider (which is the tenant-specific Azure Active Directory), is written once and cannot be changed once set. Once the authentication provider tenant property has been set for a tenant, it cannot be changed using any APIs exposed to a tenant.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p112">每个租户还使用唯一的*SubscriptionId* 。所有客户网站均由租户拥有, 并向其分配了一个对租户唯一的*SubscriptionId* 。网站上的*SubscriptionId*属性只写入一次, 且不能更改。将网站分配给租户后, 将无法在以后使用内容存储 API 将其移动到其他租户。*SubscriptionId*也是用于为身份验证提供程序创建安全作用域并与租户相关联的密钥。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p112">A unique *SubscriptionId* is also used for each tenant. All customer sites are owned by a tenant and are assigned a *SubscriptionId* unique to the tenant. The *SubscriptionId* property on a site is written once and cannot be changed. Once a site is assigned to a tenant, it cannot be moved to a different tenant later using the content store API. The *SubscriptionId* is also the key that is used to create the security scope for the authentication provider and is tied to the tenant.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p113">SharePoint Online 使用 SQL Server 和 Azure 存储来存储内容。在 SQL 级别, 内容存储区的分区键为*SiteId*。运行 SQL 查询时, SharePoint Online 将使用已验证为租户级*SubscriptionId*检查的一部分的*SiteId* 。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p113">SharePoint Online uses SQL Server and Azure storage for the storing of content. At the SQL level, the partition key for the content store is *SiteId*. When running a SQL query, SharePoint Online uses a *SiteId* that has been verified as part of a tenant-level *SubscriptionId* check.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="300b4-p114">SharePoint Online 将文件二进制 blob (例如, 文件流) 存储在 Microsoft Azure 中。每个 SharePoint Online 场都有自己的 Microsoft Azure 帐户, 保存在 Azure 中的所有 blob 都使用存储在 SQL 内容存储中的密钥进行单独加密。加密密钥不会直接暴露给最终用户, 并通过授权层在代码中受到保护。最后, SharePoint Online 在适当的位置进行实时监控, 以在 HTTP 请求读取或写入多个租户的数据时进行检测。为此, 它将根据正在访问的资源的*subscriptionid*跟踪请求标识的*subscriptionid* 。访问多个租户的资源的请求永远不应在最终用户发生。但在多租户环境中, 服务请求可能会发生这种情况。例如, 搜索爬网程序一次性提取整个数据库的内容更改。这通常涉及在单个服务请求中查询多个租户的网站, 这是出于提高效率的原因而完成的。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="300b4-p114">SharePoint Online stores file binary blobs (e.g., the file streams) in Microsoft Azure. Each SharePoint Online farm has its own Microsoft Azure account and all the blobs saved in Azure are encrypted individually using a key that is stored in the SQL content store. The encryption key is not exposed directly to the end user, and is protected in code by the authorization layer. Finally, SharePoint Online has real-time monitoring in place to detect when an HTTP request reads or writes data for more than one tenant. It does this by tracking the *SubscriptionId* of the request identity against the *SubscriptionId* of the resource being accessed. A request accessing resources of more than one tenant should never happen by end-user. It can happen for service requests in a multi-tenant environment, though. For example, the search crawler pulls content changes for an entire database all at once. This usually involves querying sites of more than one tenant in a single service request, which is done for efficiency reasons.</span></span>
